#Robocon Pathfinder UI
Robocon pathfinder in cartesian coordinate system using paper.js

#Description
This UI provides users flexibility to plot a graph to simulate the movement
of the robot which will be used for 2016's Robocon competition. Based on
this graph, minimal coordinate points will be generated and sent to the 
actual robot.
